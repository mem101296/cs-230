<strong>Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?</strong>
</br>
The client for the prolect was The Gaming Room. They have a game, which is currently available for Android called Draw It or lose It. They wanted to expand the game to other platforms using a universal web based application. This would allow for Macs, Windows, Linux, and more to access the application without needing individual local applications. 

<strong>What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?</strong>
</br>
I feel I did best with identifying the architetural recommendations of this application. It's something that I worked with in my personal and professional life.


<strong>What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?</strong>
</br>
The document gave me the needs of the application and helped me focus on the important tasks.

<strong>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</strong>
</br>
While I feel I did quite well with the entire document, I would revise the entire document. I would like to go more into detail than I did, including citations were I can.

<strong>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</strong>
</br>
I used my previous knowledge to take what's listed by the user and convert it into code. If any issues arose where I did not understand what was being asked, I would schedule a meeting to discuss said requirement.

<strong>How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?</strong>
I took the requirements and seperated them into multiple steps, allowing me to take my time and ensure that each step was complete before moving forward. This allowed me to guarantee the software could be complete at the end. I would make the software more modular to allow for easier updates and modifications.
